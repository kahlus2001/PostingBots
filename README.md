# Python Twitter Posting Bot

Developed by: Miko≈Çaj Kahl 2022

### This is a hobbyist project with the following goals:
- Show knowledge of how to build and design python projects using best practices
- Practice using 3rd party APIs

### Several Stages are planned for this project:
- [EASY] Build a bot that automatically tweets a random motivational quote fetched from the quotesAPI on a randomly selected backround image from another open-source API (TBD). The bot will run continuously and tweet a few times per day.
- [INTERMEDIATE] Build a bot that uses tweets significant stock price movements. Data will be obtained from yfinance API and several financial indicators will be calculated internally for chosen financial instruments.
- [HARD] Built a bot that scrapes the web for financial news articles and uses NLP and deep neural networks to predict whether the news in the article will have a positive or negative impact on the stock price over a given time period.
